Create-a-Logo

Module 10: A user-friendly command line tool for generating customizable SVG logos using Node.js.

Installation

Clone the repository. Install Node.js on your computer. Open the command line/terminal and run npm install. Start the application by entering node index.js and follow the prompts. Usage

This application is designed for generating simple logos for personal use. After completing the command line prompts with Node.js, a logo.svg file will be created in the 'lib' folder. Open this file in a browser to view the generated image. A sample logo is displayed below. In future updates, the application can be enhanced to create more intricate SVG logos and designs by adjusting the shape code. For example, text or characters can be integrated into the logo design.
